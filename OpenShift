OpenShift is RedHat open source container application platform for developing and hosting enterprise grade applications.

OpenShift has four different flavors 
1. OpenShift  Origin => open source project from which all others models are derived
2. OpenShift Online => is RedHatÂ´s  publicly hosted version of OpenShift origin for applications development and hosting purposes .
3. OpenShift Dedicated => is a managed private cluster on cloud platform like AWS and google
4. OpenShift  Enterprise => is the on premise private Paas offering of openShift


OpenShift Origin => is based on top of Docker containers and the kubernetes cluster manager, with added developer and operational centric tools that enable rapid application development , deployment and lifecycle management.

Docker => is the fundamental technology that powers the development of containerized applications in the form of reusable images. it enables us to create an image of our application with all the required dependencies prepackaged into images that can be instantly deployed in any environment.

Kubernetes  => powers deployment and management of these docker images across large clusters by providing self healing and auto scaling features.

Kubernetes (K8s) =>  was build by google based on their experience running containers in production.

Containers  =>  are completely isolated environments. they can have their own processes or services, their own networking interfaces, their owns mounts just like virtual machines except they all shared the same operating system kernel. 

Orchestration =>

Image => is a package or template just like VM template that you might have worked with in the virtualization world and it is use to create one or more containers.

Containers are running instances of images that are isolated and have their own environments and set of processes.

OpenShift has built in integration with build pipeline that helps developers rapidly and consistently developed, build, test and deploy applications.

The main purpose of Docker  is to containerize applications and to ship them and run them.

Most organizations have their products containerized and available in a public docker registry called Docker hub or Docker store

Load Balancer => used to load the balance 

OpenShift Architecture
OpenShift Components   
1. Kubernetes is the primary infrastructure component. so on it  you can deploy applications in the form of containers such as Docker containers
Containers are created from images of applications 

A Pod is a collection of one or more containers together. and multiple pods from a deployment 

Services are used to expose the deployments to other applications or to the external world 

At the heart of openShift lies the ETCD Key value store that stores information about various components 

OpenShift Recommended Production environment  =>  to configure multiple master and  worker nodes.

Operating System image => Ubuntu from https://www.osboxes.org/virtualbox-images/
